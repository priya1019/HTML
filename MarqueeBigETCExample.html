                        You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant.
                        <strong>The chant - one that a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede 
                        and echo across the city and the seas. </strong>

                        It is a name that continues to inspire many, not only in India, <em>but all over the world</em>, 
                        to take up the sport. <b>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar </b>was that cricketer whose personality and aura 
                        upstaged any <i>cricketing contest</i>; yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game.

                         To the people of India, the 5’5” giant of a man was much more than that. He was an emotion;
                          a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God.
