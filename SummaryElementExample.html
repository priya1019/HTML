    <p>
        Shivaji Bhonsale I, also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji, 
        was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan.
         Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire.

        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda and the Sultanate of Bijapur, as well as with European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere 
                      of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a compe
        tent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations
